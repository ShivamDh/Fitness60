### An Android Application for all types of fitness users 

This project is an Android application that can be used users during fitness
exercises and workouts of all kinds to help monitor progress and success over time

The application is still in its development stage and not complete yet, but many of the structural and 
functional components have been built and integrated into the code.

My code on Github is my most recent working copy of the application, with all source files available within their respective folders

The app was built using Android Studio, using Java and XML, and also utilizes Android SQLite for data storage
