###An Android Application for fitness users everywhere

I am in the midst of creating an Android application that can be used during fitness
exercises and workouts of all kinds to help monitor progress and success for users

The application is still building and not complete yet, but many of the structural and functional components are built
and being integrated into the code presently.

My code on Github is my most recent working copy of the application, with all source files available within their respective folders
